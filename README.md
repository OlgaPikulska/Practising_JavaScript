## General info
On image gallery page user can click on a picture to enlarge it and start swiping between results by clicking arrows. 
On video playback site user can pause a player anytime and even after refreshing the page the video will be paused at that exact moment.
Likewise to video, on feedback form page user will not loose his/her message, even after closing the browser. 
Working on this repository helped me to learn about throttle, debounce and local storage.
